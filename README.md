# price-range-slider
Hey friends, we learn how to create a Price Range Slider or Double Range Slider with Min-Max Inputs in HTML CSS & JavaScript.
I have shared a Range Slider in HTML CSS & JavaScript, and now itâ€™s time to create a price,
 multi or double range slider in vanilla JavaScript.

A price range slider is a slider where the user can slide the meter to select the appropriate price range. 
In this project (Price Range Slider in JavaScript), as We can see in the preview image, there are min-max inputs and a price range slider.

we can use a slider or enter minimum and maximum price values to select the appropriate price range. 
Mostly, this type of slider is used on e-commerce sites.
